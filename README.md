## Player turn decisions

A player strategy must make the following decisions:

First, draw or take from discard?

If draw, then decide:

- Replace either a face down or face up card on their board
- Discard the drawn card and flip up a facedown card
- OR, if there is only one facedown card, optionally skip the turn

If take from discard:

- Replace either a face down or face up card on their board
